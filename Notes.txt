REBASING:
    Remote feature/login: A-B-C
    Remote main: A-B-C
When working alone on a feature branch, you make commit D, 
    Local feature/login: A-B-C-D, 

But, main moves forward 
    Remote main: A-B-C-X
No problem pushing 
    $ git push origin feature/login # works fine
Now, 
    Remote feature/login: A-B-C-D
    Remote main: A-B-C-X

Problem comes when merging to main, history won't match since main moved forward
Now, since feature/login is your branch alone(not shared), you can rebase, then merge feature/login to main in remote repo.
    $ git fetch origin
    Local:
        origin/main: A-B-C-X
        feature/login: A-B-C-D
        after rebase: 
        feature/login: A-B-C-X-D'
    $ git checkout feature/login
    $ git rebase origin/main
    $ git push --force-with-lease origin feature/login # Safe, your branch only so you can force push

    OR
    $ git checkout feature/login    # git checkout main is DANGEROUS
    $ git pull --rebase 
    equivalent to  
    $ git fetch
    $ git rebase origin/current-branch

Then, Open PR/merge safely
    remote main: A-B-C-X-M
                        \/
                        D'

Option A:
    Open a PR:
        $ git push origin feature/login
        Now on github/gitlab, compare branch main and feature/login, Click Create Pull Request
        CI will be triggered and one of merge strategy will be used; Merge, Squash Merge, Rebase & merge(sometimes)
        remote main: A-B-C-X-M
                            \/
                            D'

Option B:
    Merge locally(small teams, solo):
        $ git checkout main
        $ git pull origin main
        $ git merge feature/login
        $ git push origin main

Error: Branch is out of date
    when main moves forward and feature/login not caught up

REMEMBER:
Feature branch:
- You rebase
- You resolve conflicts
    $ git add login.js
    $ git rebase --continue
    Repeat for each conflicted commit
- You force-with-lease push

Main branch:
- You merge
- You never rebase
- You never force-push
