Dockerize the application by creating Docker image using Dockerfile
Build the image with the following command and then run docker container for it

$ docker build -t foodfrenzyimage:v01 .

$ docker run --name foodfrenzycontainer8 -d -p 9090:8080 -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://host.docker.internal:3306/food_frenzy_db -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root -e SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=carbon123 foodfrenzyimage:v01

Above command used db that is locally hosted. But to have our db run inside a container we need docker-compose.yml and run the db container along with app container

Created docker-compose.yml with 2 containers mysql and application
Had to choose right mysql version to make sure the already loaded mysqldump.sql runs at dockerentrypoint.db

It worked


Next Goals:
Deploy it in local k8s cluster
Make it secure
create helm chart
create terraform script
Create a Jenkins pipeline
